# life
A simple particle simulation engine that applies forces to particles based on distance and color.

HOW TO USE
1. Ensure the pygame package is installed. Do "pip install pygame"
2. Do "python3 life.py"

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE
In the initialize simulation variables section in life.py, I've included plenty of parameters that 
can be changed. The program will work easily if you change num_types to 6 or less. However, with a 
little extra work it wouldn't be too difficult to allow for even more kinds of particles.

This is really nothing fancy. I coded this in about an hour or less. However, I do think there is 
some potential for this to become a really cool simulation program or game. I would love to see if anyone
wants to take this and make something else really cool out of it.
